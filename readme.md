Project requirements:
  Virtual machine with installed OS from RedHat family (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora) with the following software installed:
   - python3
   - ansible
   - docker/podman
   - cockpit behind nginx reverse proxy

  VM should be prepared and configured using IaaC tools (preferably Vagrant/Terraform, Ansible) - we should be able to recreate this VM with the same configuration in our environment by just using configuration files prepared by the candidate.

  The project should have a simple README explaining how to set up the VM from scratch.
